            <p>Hi, I'm Diane, a full-stack developer based in Paris 🥖.
                I have a passion for designing 🖍 and creating web applications with good design 🎨. 
                I am an ex-fashion designer 👗 who turned into a developer 👩🏻‍💻.
                I love to learn new technologies and share my knowledge with others.
                I am a creative, problem solver, and team player.
                I build web and mobile applications with a focus on user experience and performance.
                I built a startup called "Evenly" that helps people organize their events.
